1) check if the browser supports geolocation

2) set options for high accuracy, a 5 seconds timeout(after every 5 seconds the browser will send
new coordinates ), and no caching(we will not be saving the coordinates in cache) 

3)use watchPosition() to track the users location continuously. 

4)Emit the latitude and longitude via a socket with "send-location". Log any errors to the console.

5)Initialize a map centered at coordinates (0,0) with a zoom level of 15 using Leaflet. 

6)Add OpenStreetMap tiles to the map 

7)Create an empty object markers.

8)When receiving location data via the socket, extract id, latitude, and longitude and center the map on the new cooridnates.

9)If a marker for the id exists, update its position, otherwise, create a new marker at a given cooridntaes and add it to the map.

10)When a user disconnects, remove their marker from the map and delete it from markers.
